# CP Viewer
---

## Description
This can be hosted and used to to preview selected Crease Pattern files (.cp) files on the web browser. The program is written in pure Javascript with minimal HTML and CSS.

At the moment, little functionalities are implemented. Also, there is no intention to make this editable therefore this is only for "read-only" `.cp` file. Of course, there are still many bugs that I am hoping to fix in this short run of learning p5.js.

Below is a screenshot example of the current program which will updated along the way. It contains the half CP of my angle that was created from Oriedita.
